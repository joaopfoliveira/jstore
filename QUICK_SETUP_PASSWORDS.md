# 🚀 Quick Setup: Password Environment Variables

## ⚡ Fast Configuration (2 minutes)

### 1️⃣ Create `.env.local` file
In your project root, create a new file called `.env.local`:

```bash
# Copy and paste this template:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_PASSWORD=your_custom_site_password_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_custom_admin_password_here
```

### 2️⃣ Customize Your Passwords
Replace the example passwords with your secure passwords:

```bash
# Example with strong passwords:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_PASSWORD=MySecureSite2024!
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=AdminPanel#2024
```

### 3️⃣ Restart Server
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### 4️⃣ Test Your New Passwords
1. Visit your site → You'll see login screen
2. Enter your new `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_PASSWORD`
3. Access `/admin` → Use your new `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
